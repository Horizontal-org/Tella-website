### How do I migrate Tella to a new phone? {#how-do-i-migrate-tella-to-a-new-phone}
Unfortunately there is no way to automatically move your files and data from Tella on an old phone to Tella on a new phone.

Using Apple's Migration Assistant will not work: your files will be moved to the new phone encrypted, but not your encryption keys. As a result, you will not be able to decrypt and open these files.

In order to migrate your Tella files to a new phone, you need to install Tella on the new device, export all files out of Tella, and import those to the new phone manually. We recommend following these steps: 
  1. On your old phone go to the "All Files" folder and use the "Select all" checkbox to select all your files and folders. Keep in mind that the files will remain visible -unencrypted-, on the phone galery. 
  2. Use Quick Share (in Android), Airdrop (in iOS) or any other data transfer utility to move your files to the new device. Files will be tranfered unencrypted.
  3. On your new phone open Tella and go to the "All Files" folder, tap the "+"" button, and select "Import from device". You can choose "Delete orginal" in the dialog to make sure the files are only stored safely inside Tella. Select the files you had just exported from your old phone to import them to Tella. 
  4. Make sure you delete the files that are not secured in Tella's encrypted vault from both your phones' galeries.



### How secure is Tella? {#how-secure-is-tella}

There is no such thing as an app that is 100% "secure". Security is dependent on the threats and risks faced by each user. With this in mind, we built Tella to protect users from device searches (at checkpoints, borders, in the street, etc) and to protect sensitive files and data, both on the device and when they send them.

To do this, Tella encrypts all data in the user's device, locks using password protections, and can be hidden with a variety of camouflage options. It also encrypts all data that is sent to servers. You can read details about how do we do this, and some risks and limitations on the [Security & privacy section of Tella's](/security-and-privacy).

### Has Tella undergone security audits? {#has-tella-undergone-security-audits}

Yes! You can see all our security audits [here](/security-and-privacy#security-audits).

## Deploying Tella {#deploying-tella}

### What does it mean to "deploy" Tella? {#what-does-it-mean-to-deploy-tella}

Deploying Tella means getting Tella ready to use for your specific context and among your community or organization. This might include:

-   assessing where your data will live (for example using a third party server or self-hosting it)
-   deciding how are you going to structure your data
-   installing and configuring the server
-   training users and helping them get the app installed and configured
-   planning for maintenance of the server

Please go to the [For Organizations](/for-organizations) section to read more about deploying Tella.

### Can you help me deploy Tella? {#can-you-help-me-deploy-tella}

Yes, we'd love to! Tell us about what you want to use Tella for and in what context you want to deploy it [contact us](/contact-us) and we'll get in touch.

### How is Tella different from other documentation apps? {#how-is-tella-different-from-other-documentation-apps}

We want to help you understand if Tella is the best app for your specific context. There are other documentation apps developed by other organizations and human rights defenders that you might consider as well.

:::note
We created this comparison table to help you understand the difference between Tella and other apps available, but of course, we may be biased 😊. For comparisons by independent organizations, have a look at the links below.
