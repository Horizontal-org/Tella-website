### Does Tella work on GrapheneOS? {#does-tella-work-on-graphene-os}
As of December 2024, we haven't been able to test Tella Android and Tella FOSS on GrapheneOS, so we cannot confirm that all features work properly.

If you use GrapheneOS and you experience a problem, please [contact us](/contact-us).

Currently Tella is available in:
<TellaLanguages/>

Read more about Language accessibility in Tella [here](/accessibility).

### Where can I send my suggestions to improve Tella? {#where-can-i-send-my-suggestions-to-improve-tella}

We'd love to hear from you! Please [contact us](/contact-us)!

## Storage {#storage}

### How much storage do I need to install Tella? {#how-much-storage-do-i-need-to-install-tella}

The Tella app itself is small:

-   26MB on Android
-   7MB on iOS

The app size will grow depending on the size of the data stored on it. There is an option to configure the quality of the videos taken with Tella (Very high, High, Medium or Low) if users needs to save space. It's also possible to delete the files, photos and videos in Tella to save space.

### How much can I store in Tella? What is the storage limit? {#how-much-can-i-store-in-tella-what-is-the-storage-limit}

There is no specific storage limit for Tella, limits will depend on the system storage space available in your device.

External storage locations (like SD cards) are not currently used by Tella.


### Can i backup the data I store in Tella? {#can-i-backup-the-data-i-store in-tella?}

Yes, you can, but the process is manual for the moment. There are different alternatives available for backups:
- Establish a secure connection to a computer or phone that's in physical proximity using [Nearby Sharing](/nearby-sharing). This is the most secure method available.
- Connect to a server directly from Tella and choose the files you want to send to it. You can read more about the [servers available here](/for-organizations).
- Select files from your vault and export those to your phone using the **Save to device** button.


All exports outside of Tella's encrypted vault (to a connected server or to your phone) will be unencrypted. The only method of sharing files that transfer files directly to another encrypted vault is [Nearby Sharing](/nearby-sharing).

## Security & Privacy {#security--privacy}

### I can't remember my lock. How can I get into Tella? {#i-cant-remember-my-lock-how-can-i-get-into-tella}

Unfortunately there is no way of getting into Tella if you forgot your lock. You will have to uninstall Tella and reinstall it. There is no way of retrieving the files that were stored in Tella.

:::tip
Learn more about [Tella Locks](/video-tutorials#tella-locks) in our video tutorials.

### How do I migrate Tella to a new phone? {#how-do-i-migrate-tella-to-a-new-phone}
You can use [Nearby Sharing](/nearby-sharing) to move your files to a new phone. You will need to install Tella in your new phone, establish a secure connection to it using Nearby Sharing, select all your files, and transfer those to your new phone. This feature will work, too, for Android to iOS or iOS to Android migrations. 

If you have multiple files the full transfer might take some time. We recommend you to make sure that Tella [does not lock](/features#lock-timeout) while the transfer is in progress.  

:::tip
We recommend you to double check that all the files has been successfully transfer before deleting those in your old phone.
:::

:::info
Using Apple's Migration Assistant will not work: your files will be moved to the new phone encrypted, but not your encryption keys. As a result, you will not be able to decrypt and open these files.
:::


### How secure is Tella? {#how-secure-is-tella}

There is no such thing as an app that is 100% "secure". Security is dependent on the threats and risks faced by each user. With this in mind, we built Tella to protect users from device searches (at checkpoints, borders, in the street, etc) and to protect sensitive files and data, both on the device and when they send them.

To do this, Tella encrypts all data in the user's device, locks using password protections, and can be hidden with a variety of camouflage options. It also encrypts all data that is sent to servers. You can read details about how do we do this, and some risks and limitations on the [Security & privacy section of Tella's](/security-and-privacy).

### Has Tella undergone security audits? {#has-tella-undergone-security-audits}

Yes! You can see all our security audits [here](/security-and-privacy#security-audits).

## Deploying Tella {#deploying-tella}

### What does it mean to "deploy" Tella? {#what-does-it-mean-to-deploy-tella}

Deploying Tella means getting Tella ready to use for your specific context and among your community or organization. This might include:

-   assessing where your data will live (for example using a third party server or self-hosting it)
-   deciding how are you going to structure your data
-   installing and configuring the server
-   training users and helping them get the app installed and configured
-   planning for maintenance of the server

Please go to the [For Organizations](/for_organizations) section to read more about deploying Tella.

### Can you help me deploy Tella? {#can-you-help-me-deploy-tella}

Yes, we'd love to! Tell us about what you want to use Tella for and in what context you want to deploy it [contact us](/contact-us) and we'll get in touch.

### How is Tella different from other documentation apps? {#how-is-tella-different-from-other-documentation-apps}

We want to help you understand if Tella is the best app for your specific context. There are other documentation apps developed by other organizations and human rights defenders that you might consider as well.

:::note
We created this comparison table to help you understand the difference between Tella and other apps available, but of course, we may be biased 😊. For comparisons by independent organizations, have a look at the links below.
