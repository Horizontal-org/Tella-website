## What's Tella - Document & protect
In challenging environments, with limited or no internet connectivity or in the face of repression, Tella makes it easier and safer to document human rights violations and collect data.


## Why Tella
If you are an activist, journalist, human rights defender, or anyone who engages in documentation of injustice, you can use Tella to:

* Protect yourself from physical and digital repression while collecting and storing sensitive information.
* Protect the data you collect from censorship, tampering, interception, and destruction.
* Easily produce high quality documentation that can be used for research, advocacy, or transitional justice.
