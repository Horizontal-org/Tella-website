# Nearby Sharing

Nearby Sharing allows users to securely share files between devices using Tella. 

This feature is designed centering the needs of people living in internet shutdowns, where privacy, security and reliability are crucial to be safe while staying connected. It's also helpful in rural areas, or for protests or large events where mobile networks are saturated or unavailable.

Nearby Sharing in Tella is:
- Independent of Internet: Transfers work with or without an active internet connection, by establishing a direct connection between devices using local Wi-Fi.
- Encrypted: Files move directly from one Tella vault to another, encrypted and secure.
- Anonymous: Connection happens locally, without trace of who you shared with, when or where.

Nearby Sharing will only work in physical proximity, for users connected to the same Wi-Fi network (either a local Wi-Fi or a Hotspot).

:::danger
Some public Wi-Fi networks might not work due to their configuration preventing direct transfers.

## When to Use Nearby Sharing {#when-to-use-nearby-sharing}

Nearby Sharing may be particularly well-suited for:
- Sharing files during an internet shutdown.
- High risk scenarios where internet is censored and cannot be trusted as a communication channel
- During protests, to quickly back up evidence on another person's phone.
- To increase redundancy of data, by backing up files to a personal computer or another device.
- To migrate to a new phone.

## How to use Nearby Sharing {#how-to-use}

Tap the Nearby Sharing button under the **Connections** section on the Tella Homescreen to get stated.

In order to use the feature, the sender and receiver need join the same Wi-Fi network. You can connect to mobile devices using Tella (Android or iOS) or connect a mobile device to a computer. There are 2 ways to connect your devices though Wi-Fi:
1. Using a local network, such as the Wi-Fi at your home or work, or a public Wi-Fi network.
2. Setting up a Hotspot on a device, and make sure both the sender and receiver have joined it.

Nearby Sharing will show a tutorial that will guide users through every step of the connection process.


:::info
Nearby Sharing does not work if either of the devices is connected to a VPN.

## Platform availability {#platform-availability}

Nearby Sharing is available for Tella Android, Tella iOS, and [Tella Desktop](/get-started-desktop).


:::note
Tella Desktop can only receive files for the moment (not send).
