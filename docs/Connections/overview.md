# Tella Connections – Overview

In addition to keeping their data protected within the app, users can use **Connections** to securely share data with others. Depending on the type of connection, some possible use cases include:
- Volunteers or activists on the ground submitting forms directly to their organization from Tella.
- A group of people connecting to a drive, cloud, or shared space to send files.
- A group of activists sharing encrypted data with each other Tella users during an internet shutdown.
- An individual backing up selected files to their personal computer.


There are two main types of connections:
- [**Nearby Sharing**](#nearby-sharing): Share encrypted files with another Tella device in physical proximity. This feature does **not** require an internet connection and is typically used during internet shutdowns.
- [**Upload to a server**](#server-connections): Connect to a server and upload files over the internet so that others can access them. This feature is commonly used by organizations running data collection processes.

Connections can be configured on **Settings** → **Connections**. The Tella home screen will displays a shortcut to all connected servers. Nearby Sharing is turned on by default, but it can be disabled as well. 


## Nearby Sharing {#nearby-sharing}

Nearby Sharing can be used to transfer files directly betwee Tella vaults. It is available on Tella Android, Tella iOS, and Tella Desktop. Transfers are **end-to-end encrypted**, use the Wi-Fi protocol, and work with or without an internet connection, even on insecure or monitored networks.  

We designed this connection type with a strong focus on security, especially for use in repressive environments, and it has been [audited by an independent security firm](/security-and-privacy#security-audits).

## Server Connections {#server-connections}

Server Connections are useful for organizations leading data collection processes. Organizations can choose, configure, and manage a server to centralize data collected by volunteers or activists in the field. These individuals gather information using Tella on their devices and then send it to their organization.

Previous Tella deployments, where on-the-ground users collected data and sent it to an organization's server, have ranged from 1 to 2,000 users. You can read user stories [here](/user-stories), or [contact us](/contact) for assistance in finding the best way to use Tella for your organization.

Currently, Tella can connect to the following types of servers:

* [Open Data Kit (ODK)](/odk)
* [Uwazi](/uwazi)
* [Tella Web](/tella-web)
* [Google Drive](/g-drive)
* [Nextcloud](/nextcloud)
* [Dropbox](/dropbox)

Some individuals use commercial clouds (Google Drive, Dropbox, Nextcloud) as a backup system for their Tella data. However, we advise using this feature with caution:
- Automatic backups to any server are **not** currently available.  They need to be made manually.
- Files on the server will be accessible to anyone with server access.

:::info
All server connections are **offline first**, with built-in mechanisms to resume uploads when the internet is unreliable. Learn more about [offline data collection here](/features#offline-data-collection).
:::

:::danger
Even though data is transferred to the server securely (SSL), files stored on the server are **not** encrypted. Anyone with access to the server can view them.
