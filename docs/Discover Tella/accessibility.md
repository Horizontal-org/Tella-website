# Language and Accessibility in Tella

Making Tella accessible is a top priority for us. When we say accessible, we mean that we do our best to ensure that disabled users and users with limited literacy or tech literacy can use Tella, and that Tella is available in as many languages, devices and contexts as possible.


### Language accessibility {#language-accessibility}

We work hard to make Tella available in languages spoken by communities who express the need for Tella. Unfortunately, we don't always have the capacity or resources to keep all translations up to date. If you wish to contribute to the translation of Tella, [join us here](/translating-tella). If you want us to add a new language but you cannot contribute to it, [contact us](/contact-us). Currently Tella Android and iOS are available in:

<TellaLanguages/>

[Video Tutorials](/video-tutorials) have subtitles available in Spanish, Arabic, Swahili and French.


### WCAG accessibility {#wcag-accessibility}

In this table you can access our latest accessibility reports for each platform. 

| **Platform** | **Date** | **Link** |
| -----|-----|------ |  
| Tella Android | November 2023 | [Link](</assets/2023.11 - Tella Android accessibility audit.docx.pdf>) | 
| Tella iOS | November 2023 | [Link](</assets/2023.11 - Tella iOS accessibility audit.docx.pdf>) | 

We are currently working on solving all the A Level accessibility issues detected in Tella Android.

### Offline accessibility {#offline-accessibility}
Tella does not need internet for collecting or storing files, not to use any of the security features. [Connections](/connections) are offline-first, with built in mechanisms for retrying and re-submitting reports if internet is not readily available. Tella also offers a fully [offline file sharing feature](/nearby-sharing) designed for rural areas or areas facing internet shutdowns.


### Device accessibility {#device-accessibility}
We implement each feature trying maximize device accessibility, even for older devices. [Read here about what phones support Tella](/faq#what-phones-support-tella).
