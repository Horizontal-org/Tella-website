# Language and Accessibility on Tella

Making Tella accessible is a top priority for us. When we say accessible, we mean that we do our best to ensure that disabled users and users with limited literacy or tech literacy can use Tella.


### Language accessibility {#language-accessibility}

We work hard to make Tella available in languages spoken by communities who express the need for Tella. Unfortunately, we don't always have the capacity or resources to keep all translations up to date. If you wish to contribute to the translation of Tella, [join us here](/translating-tella). If you want us to add a new language, [contact us](/contact-us), and we'll do our best to add it. Currently Tella Android and iOS are available in:
