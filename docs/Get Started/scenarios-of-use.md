## Crossing borders

Crossing boarders could potentially imply a thorough search on your device, you can consider using:
- [Camouflage](/features#camouflage): If having Tella on your phone might raise suspicion, you can disguise it as another app and change its icon and name.
- [Quick exit](/features#quick-exit): To make sure Tella is locked.
- [Quick delete](/features#quick-delete): To fully delete all content of your Tella vault. 
- [Restrict unlock attempts](/features#restrict-unlocking-attempts): So reduce the risk of people trying to brute-force their access to Tella.

## Data collection for organizations

Journalists, activists and human rights defenders use Tella to secure the data their team collects in the ground, while also allowing them to securely share the data with the organization they work with. Some common use cases are human rights documentation processes, sensitive journalist investigations or election monitoring processes. Some useful features can be:

- [Server Connections](/for-organizations): Send information directly to Tella Web, ODK, Uwazi, Google Drive, Nextcloud or Dropbox. Some available features include structured submissions from multiple contributors, even in different locations.
- [Security features](/security-and-privacy): Depending on the risk assessment for the users on the ground, additional security features could be helpful as well.
