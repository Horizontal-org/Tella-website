# Scenarios of Use

Based on common questions from users, we drafted a non exhaustive list of scenarios, and which Tella features could be useful for each one.  This list is meant for general guidance, [contact us](/contact-us) if you would like our help with a risk assessment, and determining which features of Tella could be right for your context.


## Crossing borders {#crossing-borders}

Crossing boarders could potentially imply a thorough search on your device, you can consider using:
- [Camouflage](/features#camouflage): If having Tella on your phone might raise suspicion, you can disguise it as another app.
- [Quick exit](/features#quick-exit): To make sure Tella is locked.
- [Quick delete](/features#quick-delete): To fully delete all content of your Tella vault. 
- [Back up your files](/features#backup-files): Take into account that if you delete the content of your Tella vault, there is no way to restore it (unless backed up your files to another location).
- [Restrict unlock attempts](/features#restrict-unlocking-attempts): To reduce the risk of people trying to brute-force their access to Tella.


## Data collection for organizations {#data-collection-for-organizations}

Journalists, activists and human rights defenders use Tella to secure the data their team collects in the ground, while also allowing them to securely share the data with the organization they work with. Some common use cases are human rights documentation processes, sensitive journalist investigations or election monitoring processes. Some useful features can be:
- [Server Connections](/for-organizations): Send information directly to Tella Web, Open Data Kit(ODK), Uwazi, Google Drive, Nextcloud or Dropbox. Some available features include structured submissions from multiple contributors, even in different locations. All server connections are offline-first.
- [Security features](/security-and-privacy): Depending on the risk assessment for the users on the ground, additional security features could be helpful as well.
- [Organizational deployment support](/faq#deploying-tella): We can help you decide what's the best security configuration for your users on the ground, choose a server connection and training your users. 

## Internet shutdowns {#internet-shutdowns}

When there is  an intentional disruption of internet access, or when the internet or intranet of a specific country or location is censored and cannot be trusted, you might find helpful:
- [Nearby Sharing](/nearby-sharing): For sharing files locally, anonymously, between 2 devices with Tella, directly from one encrypted container to another one.

## Demonstrations, protests or raids {#demonstrations-protests-or-raids}

During large events there might be an increased risk of device confiscation (in order to try to delete evidence) or difficulties in communications. On these cases you might find helpful:
- [Nearby Sharing](/nearby-sharing): For sharing files locally between 2 devices with Tella, directly from one encrypted container to another one, even when mobile networks might be are saturated or unavailable.
- [Quick delete](/features#quick-delete): To fully delete all content of your Tella vault. 
- [Back up your files](/features#backup-files): Take into account that if you delete the content of your Tella vault, there is no way to restore it (unless backed up your files to another location).
- [Restrict unlock attempts](/features#restrict-unlocking-attempts): So reduce the risk of people trying to brute-force their access to Tella.
- [Camouflage](/features#camouflage): If having Tella on your phone might raise suspicion, you can disguise it as another app.



## Rural or low-connectivity areas {#rural-or-low-connectivity-areas}

We build Tella [centering the needs of people that don't have a reliable internet connection](/accessibility). Some helpful features might be:
- [Offline data collection](features#offline-data-collection): All our sever connections are offline first, users in the ground can set up their server connection and save submissions either on Drafts or Outbox tab, so those can be submited as soon as the phone regains internet connection.
- [Nearby Sharing](/nearby-sharing): For sharing files locally between 2 devices with Tella, directly from one encrypted container to another one.
