# Community & Contributing


## Tella community meetings

### What

Each month, Horizontal hosts a community call with users, partners, or anyone interested in Tella. During these calls, we:

-   showcase Tella’s new features
-   share roadmaps and upcoming developments
-   answer any questions that users might have
-   listen to feedback feature requests so we can incorporate them into our planning
-   host guest speakers who share about their own use and experience with Tella and their learnings

### When

Community calls are held on the first Wednesday of each month at 3pm GMT.


### Where

Our community calls take place on Jitsi, a privacy-friendly, open-source video calling platform.

You can join the call using this link: <https://meet.jit.si/moderated/72928f9f16445dfc04dfbba14cb65fecd979f68cb053ddae3cc936192063471f>

### Safety and privacy

!! To ensure safety of all participant, anyone joining the Tella community calls agrees to abide by [Horizontal's Code of Conduct](https://horizontal-org.slite.com/app/docs/E33mV5cWaJhd8x/Horizontal-Code-of-Conduct). Please take some time to get familiar with it.

Tella community calls are hosted on Jitsi Meet’s public instance. Jitsi does not require sign up and does not collect and retain data about users. However, <u>**the link to the meeting is shared publicly and broadly**</u>. Please take precautions to keep your identity hided if that is important for your safety (for example, you can use a pseudonym) and avoid sharing any sensitive information during the call.

While Horizontal may take some notes about conversations, questions, and comments during the community calls, we will never record nor share any personally identifiable data about participants (name or organization) with anyone outside of Horizontal.

We may collect general information about the call (number of participants and their country or region, when voluntarily shared) and, to follow up on bug reports or feature requests, take notes of participant name and contact information.

## Open source

The security and privacy of Tella users is at the core of our mission. It is therefore natural for the application's code to be entirely open-source. This means that it is publicly available for review: anyone can audit our code to verify that we don't misuse user data, that we actually do what we say, and that our code is robust.

Tella's code for both Android and iOS can be accessed [here on our GitHub repository](https://github.com/horizontal-org). Rather than blindly trust us, you can audit the code yourself or ask someone you trust to do it, or read the reports that independent security firms wrote after auditing Tella’s code [add link].

We also publish and maintain a fully Free and Open Source version of Tella for Android that doesn't contain any closed-source or proprietary library or dependency, and that is free from any trackers. You can find the code for that version of Tella [here on Github](https://github.com/Horizontal-org/).


## Translating Tella

Language accessibility is one of our priorities, so we work hard to make Tella available in languages spoken by communities who express the need for Tella.

Currently, Tella is available (partially or in full) in:



* Arabic
* Belarusian
* Burmese
* English
* Indonesian
* Jingpho
* Kannada
* Karen Sgaw
* Malayalam
* Portuguese
* Russian
* Spanish (Latin America)
* Tamil

Unfortunately, we don't always have the capacity or resources to keep all translations up to date and would love your support!

If you wish to contribute to the translation of Tella,[ join us here.](https://app.lokalise.com/public/9394139661a3d89da6fa91.77098206/) If you want us to add a new language, send us an email: [contact@tella-app.org](mailto:contact@tella-app.org).
