# Community & Contributing


## Community calls

Every month, we hosty community calls where we:

* Showcase Tella’s new features
* Share roadmaps and upcoming developments 
* Answer any questions that users might have 
* Listen to feedback feature requests so we can incorporate them into our planning
* Host guest speakers sharing about how they use Tella and their learnings

Community calls are held on the first Wednesday of every month at 3pm GMT. 

The community call link is [this one](https://meet.jit.si/moderated/72928f9f16445dfc04dfbba14cb65fecd979f68cb053ddae3cc936192063471f). Please add the event to your calendar [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MDM1Z252cjVkamRkMWVpb2VyNDRvOTV2NGpfMjAyMzAzMDFUMTUwMDAwWiBjYXJvQHdlYXJlaG9yaXpvbnRhbC5vcmc&tmsrc=caro%40wearehorizontal.org&scp=ALL) Note that any participant to the Tella community calls must respect [[Horizontal’s Code of Conduct](https://horizontal-org.slite.com/app/docs/E33mV5cWaJhd8x/Horizontal-Code-of-Conduct)].


## Open source

The security and privacy of Tella users is at the core of our mission. It is therefore natural for the application's code to be entirely open-source. This means that it is publicly available for review: anyone can audit our code to verify that we don't misuse user data, that we actually do what we say, and that our code is robust.

Tella's code for both Android and iOS can be accessed[ here on our GitHub repository](https://github.com/horizontal-org). Rather than blindly trust us, you can audit the code yourself or ask someone you trust to do it, or read the reports that independent security firms wrote after auditing Tella’s code [add link].

We also publish and maintain a fully Free and Open Source version of Tella for Android that doesn't contain any closed-source or proprietary library or dependency, and that is free from any trackers. You can find the code for that version of Tella [here on Github] and [download it from F-Droid].


## Translating Tella

Language accessibility is one of our priorities, so we work hard to make Tella available in languages spoken by communities who express the need for Tella.

Currently, Tella is available (partially or in full) in:



* Arabic
* Belarusian
* Burmese
* English
* Indonesian
* Jingpho
* Kannada
* Karen Sgaw
* Malayalam
* Portuguese
* Russian
* Spanish (Latin America)
* Tamil

Unfortunately, we don't always have the capacity or resources to keep all translations up to date and would love your support!

If you wish to contribute to the translation of Tella,[ join us here.](https://app.lokalise.com/public/9394139661a3d89da6fa91.77098206/) If you want us to add a new language, send us an email: [contact@tella-app.org](mailto:contact@tella-app.org).
