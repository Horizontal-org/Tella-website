# Translating Tella

Language accessibility is one of our priorities, so we work hard to make Tella available in languages spoken by communities who express the need for Tella.

Currently, Tella Android and iOS are available (partially or in full) in:


<TellaLanguages/>


[Video Tutorials](/video-tutorials) have subtitles in Spanish, Arabic, Swahili and French.

## How do I become a translator? {#how-do-i-become-a-translator}
Thank you for your interest in helping us with translations. Our localization efforts are supported by the [Localization Lab](https://www.localizationlab.org/). 

Before translating, please read through the Tella Project page on the [Localization Lab Wiki](https://wiki.localizationlab.org/index.php/Tella) and this documentation page. On these pages you will find a lot of information about the project, including our guidelines, resources, and priorities that will help you make the most out of your contribution.

### Quick Start Guide {#quick-start-guide}
Tella is an application that makes it easier and safer to document human rights violations and collect data.

### Why Tella {#why-tella}
If you are an activist, journalist, human rights defender, or anyone who engages in documentation of injustice, you can use Tella to:
- Protect yourself from physical and digital repression while collecting and storing sensitive information.
- Protect the data you collect from censorship, tampering, interception, and destruction.
- Easily produce high-quality documentation that can be used for research, advocacy, or transitional justice.

The Tella App is written in English and translated into multiple other languages. Translations are managed using Lokalise, a web platform that enables collaborative translation projects.
