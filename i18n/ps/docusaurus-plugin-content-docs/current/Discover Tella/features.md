# Tella features

All of the following features are available to all users as soon as they download Tella. They do not require any connection to a server or any special set up. 

<FeaturesTable/>


## App lock {#app-lock}

When installing Tella, the user has to select a lock üîí to encrypt and decrypt the content of the app.


* On Android, the user can select a pattern, PIN, or password.
* On iOS, the user can select a PIN or password.

Without this lock, it is not possible to open Tella.

:::danger
If the user loses their lock, it is not possible to regain access to Tella and the files stored inside the app. The user has to uninstall and reinstall Tella, and all files will be lost. üîíüîëüö™

## Background encryption {#background-encryption}

Tella [encrypts](#encryption) files in the background so that users can continue performing actions (take more photos or videos, import more files, etc) while files are being encrypted. Users can see ongoing activities that are taking place in the background in a **Background activity tray** that's accessible from the Tella homescreen, by tapping on the "notifications" icon (üîî) on the top left. 

While files are being encrypted, Tella displays an orange marker on the notifications icon. If the user opens the background activity tray while some files are being encrypted, they will see the list of files in the queue and the encryption progress.

:::danger
If the user hard exit Tella (for example by using [Quick Exit](#quick-exit) or minimizing the app) while files are being encrypted in the background, those will be lost.
:::

:::info
If [verification mode](/features#verification-mode) is turned on, background encryption is automatically disabled to make sure that all file metadata is captured at the same time as the photo, video, or audio file is saved.  
:::

## Backup files to a cloud {#backup-files}
We are in the process of adding options for individuals and organizations to backup their data to different clouds. Backups, for the moment, need to be made manually, by creating reports (using, for example, the date of "today" as the report title) and submitting them to the connected server. Files will be available on the connected server inside a folder with the report title.

For the moment we support the following connections. Follow each of the links to find details and step-by-step guides on how to connect and use each of them:
* [Open Data Kit (ODK)](/odk)
* [Uwazi](/uwazi)
* [Tella Web](/tella-web)
* [Google Drive](/g-drive)
* [Nextcloud](/nextcloud)
* [Dropbox](/dropbox)

On this table we explain what server types are available on the Tella apps:
<ConnectionsTable/>.


:::danger
For the moment, the submission to any type of server it is **not** encrypted. People who have access to the server itself are able to see the files.
:::



## Lock timeout configuration {#lock-timeout-configuration}

By default Tella will lock immediately every time the user exits the app or your phone‚Äôs screen turns off. If you‚Äôd like to change this setting, the user can do so by going to 

Settings ‚öôÔ∏è > Security > Lock Timeout.

The available options are 1 minute, 5 minutes, 30 minutes and 1 hour. ‚è±Ô∏è

:::info
Please use this feature carefully as if Tella is unlocked the data would be unprotected and anyone who enters Tella will be able to see all information there.
:::

:::info
When the camera or the audio recorder are open, Tella won‚Äôt lock

## Screen security {#screen-security}

By default Tella blocks screenshots, screen recordings inside Tella and hides the screen preview in the list of recent apps üì±üîí. It is possible to disable this security feature if the users need to take screenshots or screen recordings, or to mirror Tella to a computer for a presentation, by going to **Settings** ‚öôÔ∏è > **Security** > **Screen security**.

On iOS screen security only blocks screen recordings inside Tella and blocks the screen in the list of recent apps, but it‚Äôs not possible to disable screenshots or screen recordings.

:::

## Restrict unlocking attempts {#restrict-unlocking-attempts}
By going to **Settings ‚öôÔ∏è** > **Security** > **Delete after Failed Unlock**, the user can decide how many failed unlock attempts are allowed before everything inside Tella is deleted.

By default, this setting is Off, which means unlock attempts are not restricted and data won't be deleted. The user can choose to restrict unlocking attempts to 5, 10, or 20. If they choose any of these options, they can also select whether to display a visual indicator on the unlock screen 3 attempts before the specified number (3 attempts remaining, 2 attempts remaining, etc.), or to show no visual indicator at all.

After the specified number of failed attempts, all files, connections, and everything in Tella get deleted, and the user will go back to the "freshly installed" app state.

:::info
The Restrict unlocking attempts feature cannot be enabled if Calculator camouflage is enabled.
:::

:::danger
While this security setting prevents brute force unlocking attempts to enter Tella, it should be used with caution, as there is no way to restore the content of Tella once the maximum number of failed unlocking attempts is reached.
:::

## Edit Media {#edit-media}
We are in the process of adding the ability to edit media files directly within Tella's encrypted container, so users don't longer need to export their files outside Tella for editing those.

| **Media Type** | **Feature** | **Tella Android** | **Tella iOS** | **Tella FOSS** |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| ÿßŸÜ⁄ÅŸàÿ±          | Crop        | ‚úîÔ∏è                | ‚úîÔ∏è            | ‚úîÔ∏è             |
| ÿßŸÜ⁄ÅŸàÿ±          | Rotate      | ‚úîÔ∏è                | ‚úîÔ∏è            | ‚úîÔ∏è             |
| ÿßŸÜ⁄ÅŸàÿ±          | Flip        | ‚úîÔ∏è                | Not yet       | ‚úîÔ∏è             |
| ÿßŸÜ⁄ÅŸàÿ±          | Auto-zoom        | ‚úîÔ∏è                | Not yet       | ‚úîÔ∏è        |
| Ÿà€å⁄â€åŸà          | Trim        | Not yet       | ‚úîÔ∏è          | Not yet        |
| Ÿà€å⁄â€åŸà          | Rotate      | Not yet       | ‚úîÔ∏è          | Not yet        |
| ÿß⁄â€åŸà          | Trim        | Not yet           |  ‚úîÔ∏è          | Not yet        |

Users can edit a picture by going to **More** > **Edit** from the **Images** folder or by tapping the **Edit** button on the top right while viewing image you have on Tella. 
- **Rotate**:  Use the Rotate button at the bottom of the screen to rotate the image counter-clock wise. 
- **Crop**: Drap the corners of the white canvas to crop the picture. 
- **Auto-zoom**: The image will automatically zoom in and out depending on the selected canvas, to avoid loosing image quality.
- **Flip**: Use the flip buttons to mirror the image horizontally or vertically.

When edits are done, users can press the orange check on the top right of the edit screen. The edited file will be saved as a copy of the original file in the same folder.


Users can edit videos or audio recordings: 
- In any folder, next to the file to be edited, by tapping on **‚Åù** > **Edit**.
- While listening to an audio recording or watching a video in Tella, by tapping the **Edit** button in the top right corner. 

Current editing options include:
- **Trim**: Move the vertical orange lines to select the new start and end point of your audio or video. 
- **Rotate**: Use the Rotate button on the top right of the screen to rotate the video counter-clock wise.

Use the Play button at the bottom of the screen to listen to the audio or the Cancel button to start over. When you are done editing the file, use the orange scissors ‚úÇÔ∏è icon in the top-right corner to save the trimmed audio or video. The edited file will be saved as a copy of the original file in the same folder.


## Encryption {#encryption}

All files stored inside Tella are encrypted. Without the app lock, it is impossible to decrypt and access any of the files stored in Tella. üîíüîê

Upon installing the app, the user decides which lock method they would like to use. For Android, the user can use a six-point pattern, a PIN, or a password. For iOS, they can use a PIN or a password. The app cannot be opened without the lock.

Even if the device is plugged into a computer and all the device's data is extracted to be analyzed, all Tella content and data will look like gibberish and will be useless. Unlocking the app by entering the correct lock is the only way to decrypt, and therefore read, the content stored in Tella.

:::danger
If the user‚Äôs lock is too weak, an adversary may be able to guess it and open the app on the phone; or the data could be extracted and a computer could brute-force the encryption key and decrypt the data.
:::

:::danger
If the user forgets their lock, there is no way of gaining access to the app and retrieving its content
:::

:::info 
Technnical details about encryption can be found on the [Security and Privacy](/security-and-privacy) section.
:::

## File management {#file-management}

Tella allows users to manage files and folders in a similar way they would do on a computer. All files and folders are **encrypted and only accessible within Tella**. üìÇüìù

In Tella, users can:

* Store any file, including photos üì∑, videos üé•, audio files üéß, and documents üìù.
* In the All Files folder:
    - Create folders and subfolders.
    - Move files into folders and from one folder to another.
* Export files to their device. Once saved on their device outside of Tella, files are no longer encrypted and can be accessed by anyone searching the device.
* Import files from their device. Files are automatically encrypted when imported into Tella. 

:::danger
Importing files from the device file system into Tella makes a copy of the files into Tella. Tella will ask if you want to keep or delete the original file from your phone when importing. If you choose to keep the original file, they will be present on the device, outside of Tella and unencrypted. üîí
:::

## Feedback {#feedback}

There are several options for Tella users to [contact the Tella team](/contact-us) in order to suggest improvements, report bugs and issues and request support. Inside Tella there are 2 alternatives: 

1. **Email:**
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **About and Help** > **Contact us** to find the email address.
   - Users can email the Tella team using their preferred email app.

2. **In-App Feedback Form:**
   - Go to **Settings** > **Feedback** to enable an in-app feedback form.
   - This allows users to share feedback with the Tella team anonymously.


To ensure user privacy and anonymity, only essential data is transmitted to our Feedback server through HTTPS POST requests. Logs containing user information (IP address, date and time, and user-agent) are automatically deleted weekly.

On the Feedback server database, we only store a copy of the text sent by users in the feedback form and which platform it came from (Android or iOS).


:::info 
The only information that we will receive is the content that users specifially add on the feedback form. If users are requesting support or want us to follow up with them, they should provide a secure way for us to contact them.
:::


## Import files from device {#import-files-from-device}

The user can import files into Tella to keep them secured by using the import feature. They can import files by going to the **Add ( + )** button on either All files, Images, Video, Audio or Documents depending on the type of file they wish to import and then **Import from device** üì•. A prompt will appear asking the user if they would like to keep or delete the original file from their phone memory. The imported files will be kept secured at Tella.

:::

## Preserve metadata when importing {#preserve-metadata-when-importing}

On **Settings** > **Security** users have the option to Preserve or delete the file's metadata when importing Photos and Videos to Tella. EXIF metadata of files migth include data about when the file was created, camera settings or location of the device.

## Privacy preserving analytics (opt-in) {#privacy-preserving-analytics}
Android users can opt-in to share analytics to improve Tella. All information is anonymous, agregated and can never be linked to individual usres. For technical information about what system do we use and what metrics to we collect, visit the [Analytics section of the Security and Privacy page](/security-and-privacy#analytics).

## Open files in Tella {#open-files-in-tella}
Images, videos, PDFs and audios can be visualized inside Tella. üì±üìÑ

## Camouflage {#camouflage}

On Tella Android, it is possible to camouflage Tella in two ways:

1. Users can change the name and icon of the app, to make it look like another app like a game or weather app. üéÆüå¶Ô∏è
2. Users can hide Tella behind a fully functional calculator. In order to open Tella, the user must input their PIN into the calculator followed by **=** . The Calculator camouflage is only possible if the user uses a PIN lock. It is not possible to camouflage Tella as a Calculator if pattern or password is used. üî¢üîí

At this time, due to restrictions on the Apple App Store, Tella for iOS does not support the camouflaging features that are available on Tella Android. 

:::danger
The name "Tella" and its icon will remain visible in the Android settings. This means that camouflage will not protect against an individual _actively_ looking for Tella on the phone or conducting an in-depth analysis of the device. üîíüëÄ
:::

:::info
The Calculator camouflage feature cannot be enabled if the Restrict unlock attempts feature is on.

## Homescreen customization {#homescreen-customization}

By default Tella's home screen organizes files by type: üì∑ images, üé• videos, üéß audio, üìÑ documents, and other files. It also provides an All files section where all files can be accessed. For more information see File Management section.

For convenience and ease of access, it is also possible to customize the home screen to also show shortcuts to one or more of the following:

* Recent files, to quickly open the newest files in Tella üíº
* Favorite forms, for users connected to an ODK server üìù
* Favorite templates, for users connected to an Uwazi server üìã

This configuration can be found in **Settings** > **General**. 


## Quick delete {#quick-delete}

A Quick Delete button allows users, in just a few seconds, to delete sensitive data within Tella. Quick delete can be configured on **Settings** > **Security** > **Quick delete**, where the user can choose to enable a sliding button on the home screen to quickly delete information from Tella in emergency situations. If enabled, the user can choose exactly what gets deleted when the feature is used. The available options are:

* Delete files: Deletes all files stored in Tella üóëÔ∏è
* Delete draft and submitted forms: Deletes drafts and submitted forms in all Connections. [Visit the For Organizations page](/for-organizations) to  discover the available server connections üìù
* Delete server settings: Deletes all server connections and all the forms, templates or reports associated with them üìã
* Delete Tella: Deletes the app and all the data it contains. It triggers a message asking if the user wants to uninstall Tella as well ‚ùå. 

:::info Delete Tella
The Delete Tella option might not be available on some Android phones due to technical limitations. We are working on a fix for this issue. For iOS it is not possible to programmatically delete an app. 
:::

## Quick exit {#quick-exit}

By clicking the exit button on Tella‚Äôs home screen right top corner, Android users can quickly close and lock the app in case of emergency. While having the lock timeout set to ‚Äúimmediately‚Äù means that the app already locks when the user exits, using the Quick Exit button adds an extra layer of security and assurance that the app will be fully closed and locked üîí

On iOS, it is not possible to shut down an app from inside the app itself. Tapping the quick exit button instead locks the app.

## Verification mode {#verification-mode}

In the Tella settings, users can activate "Verification Mode" ‚úÖ

When activated, every time a user takes a photo or a video, or records audio, Tella automatically captures verification information (file metadata). This verification information can be used to corroborate evidence, cross-check with other facts known about the event or about the area where it was captured. The verification information will be included as a separated file when saving the file to the device or when sharing it through third-party apps. The file format is .CSV with the metadata information included in columns. This file can be open with any spreadsheets app (like Excel, Google Spreadsheets, or OpenOffice). 

:::info Contact us
If you need help to better understand Verification Mode, feel free to contact us üòä
:::

Below is a list of each piece of metadata captured by Tella:

**Information about the file**

* File path: where the file was located in the Tella directory üìÇ
* File hash: a unique number to identify the file üîç
* File modified: the date and time the file was last modified on the device üìÖ

**Information about the device**

* Manufacturer: the name of the device manufacturer üì±
* Hardware: the exact model of the device üíª
* Device ID: a unique number identifying the Android device üÜî
* Screen size: the exact screen size of the device üìè
* Language: the language the device's operating system is set to üåê
* Locale: the geographic region the device is set to üåç
* Connection status: whether the device is connected or disconnected to the internet üì∂
* Network type: if the device is connected to the internet, specifies whether it is to a WiFi network or to a cellular network üì≤
* Wi-Fi MAC: a unique identifier to the device's Wi-Fi connector üîç
* IPv4: a unique address identifying the device's internet connection üîó
* IPv6: a more recent identifier to a device's internet connection üîó

**Information about the environment where the file was captured**

* Location: the exact location of the device, include latitude and longitude coordinates, altitude in meters, the accuracy of the measurement in meters, and the time üåç
* Location provider: how device location is determined üìç
* Location speed: the speed at which the device is traveling üöÄ
* Cell info: the identifying numbers of all the cell towers the device is connected to üì°
* WiFi info: the name of all WiFi networks in the vincinity of the device üîç

## Connecting to servers {#connecting-to-servers}

Users can collect data directly in Tella, keep the data protected within the app, and connect to a server to securely send the data to a server. This feature is frequently used by organizations who centralize the data collected by volunteers or activist on the ground. These people collect information using Tella on their phones and then send it to their organizations. Previous Tella deployments where on-the-ground users collect data and send it to an organization's server have ranged from 1 to 2,000 users. üì≤ üì°

Currently the servers that can be connected to Tella are:

* [Open Data Kit (ODK)](/odk)
* [Uwazi](/uwazi)
* [Tella Web](/tella-web)
* [Google Drive](/g-drive)
* [Nextcloud](/nextcloud)
* [Dropbox](/dropbox)

## Camera (photos and videos) {#camera-photos-and-videos}

Tella offers a built-in camera where you can take photos and videos. All media collected inside Tella will not be available outside of it, as all files get encrypted as soon as they are taken. Files can only be accessed inside Tella, using the lock to open the app. Photos and videos won‚Äôt appear on the phone Gallery. In Tella, photos and videos will have a default name, but users can rename those using the Rename button. Files can also be organized in folders. üì∑

The camera offers the possibility to change the resolution of videos before recording in order to save space: the lower the resolution, the less space the video takes, but also the lower the quality of the video. üé• üíæ

In [Tella-FOSS](/faq#is-tella-available-on-f-droid), where we use the fully open-source CameraX library, some of the Camera‚Äôs features (zoom, flip camera, enable flash, enable grid, change video resolution) are missing.


## Select video resolution {#select-video-resolution}
You can easily choose your desired video resolution on Tella by accessing the video recording screen and tapping on the Settings button. The available options include:
- Highest possible resolution
- High resolution (1080p)
- Medium resolution (720p)
- Low resolution (480p)

Video resolution refers to the number of pixels in each frame of the video. Higher resolutions, such as 1080p or 720p, result in sharper and more detailed videos. However, keep in mind that higher resolution videos also have larger file sizes, which may require more storage space on your device.

It's important to note that selecting video resolution is currently only supported on Android devices.


## Audio Recorder {#audio-recorder}

Tella has a built-in audio recorder. All audio recorded inside Tella will not be available outside of it, as all files get encrypted as soon as they are taken. Audio files can only be accessed inside Tella, using the lock to open the app. Recordings will not appear on the phone‚Äôs Voice Recording app or file system. In Tella, audio files will have a default name, but users can rename those using the Rename button. Audio recordings can also be organized in folders. üé§ üéß

The audio recorder allows users to pause the recording and restart it as needed, keeping all the information on the same file. Users see how much space they have available while recording, to ensure they will not be out of space while recording. üìà üíæ


## Offline data collection {#offline-data-collection}

Once Tella is installed and configured on the phone, it doesn't need an internet connection to collect data. üì≤ An internet connection is only needed to share files through other apps or through Connections. üåê If users have a server connected, once the forms or templates are downloaded to the phone, all data collected will be stored on the outbox tab and they can upload it to the server once they connect to the internet. üì©
